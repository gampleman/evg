{-| Make drawings draggable by saying what they can _become_.

The usual way to make something draggable is to handle pointer events: on
press remember where you grabbed, on move work out the new position, on
release snap it somewhere sensible, and maybe animate. Every new interaction
means new arithmetic, and anything fancier than "follow the pointer" (snap to
slots, reorder a list, rotate a dial, move a card between piles) gets
complicated quickly.

This module turns that around. You keep writing a plain view function from
your state to a drawing. On anything draggable you say which _states_ dragging
it can lead to. The library draws those states (without showing them), looks
at where the dragged element ends up in each, and works out the rest: which
state the pointer is heading towards, how to blend the drawing in between,
where to land on release, and how to animate the landing.

    type alias State =
        { on : Bool }

    toggle : Drag.View State msg
    toggle ctx s =
        Evg.group []
            [ Evg.rect [ Evg.cornerRadius 30, Evg.fillStr "#ddd" ]
                { x = 0, y = 0, width = 120, height = 60 }
            , Evg.circle
                [ Evg.fillStr "white"
                , Drag.onDrag ctx "knob" (\() -> Drag.between [ { on = False }, { on = True } ])
                ]
                { r = 26
                , center =
                    if s.on then
                        ( 90, 30 )

                    else
                        ( 30, 30 )
                }
            ]

That is a complete toggle switch: the knob slides between its two positions
as you drag (the drawing is blended between the two states), and on release
it settles into whichever is closer.

![A toggle switch at four moments of a drag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gampleman/evg/master/docs/images/drag-between.svg)

Above, the switch at four moments: grabbed, a third of the way across, two
thirds, and dropped. Note that the track's colour changes along with the
knob's position; nothing in the code above says it should, it follows from
blending the two drawings.

These ideas come from the paper [_Declarative Dragging_](https://declarative-dragging.github.io/)
and its library Dragology, by Joshua Horowitz, Andrew Blinn and Jeffrey Heer.


# Wiring it up

A draggable drawing has a [`Model`](#Model) holding the current state. Hook
its [`update`](#update), [`subscriptions`](#subscriptions) and
[`view`](#view) into your program like any other component:

    type alias Model =
        { toggle : Drag.Model State }

    type Msg
        = ToggleMsg (Drag.Msg State)

    update msg model =
        case msg of
            ToggleMsg dragMsg ->
                { model | toggle = Drag.update toggle dragMsg model.toggle }

    subscriptions model =
        Sub.map ToggleMsg (Drag.subscriptions model.toggle)

    view model =
        Evg.svg []
            { width = 120, height = 60 }
            [ Drag.view ToggleMsg toggle model.toggle ]

# Specs

A [`Spec`](#Spec) describes what dragging an element does. The basic specs
pick between states in different ways; the modifiers further down adjust
how they behave.

@docs Spec, fixed


## Blending between states

@docs between, betweenSpecs, betweenWith, BetweenOptions, Interpolation


## Snapping to the nearest option

@docs closest, closestSpecs, closestWith, ClosestOptions


## Continuous values

# Modifiers

@docs withOverlay


# Transitions

Dropping something and switching between options animate by default, for 0.2
seconds with [`Animate.easeOut`](Evg-Animate#easeOut). These let you change
that. They take the same durations (in seconds) and easings as
[`Evg.Animate`](Evg-Animate), so motion looks consistent across a drawing.
A duration of 0 switches the animation off.

-- VIEW FUNCTIONS


{-| A view function for a draggable drawing. It is an ordinary function from
your state to a drawing, with one extra argument, the [`Context`](#Context),
which you need for [`onDrag`](#onDrag).

The library calls it many times per frame while dragging, on states that may
never be shown, so keep it a pure function of its arguments.

-}
type alias View state msg =
    Context state msg -> state -> Evg msg


{-| What a [`View`](#View) needs to know while it draws.
-}
type Context state msg
    = Context
        { toMsg : Maybe (Msg state -> msg)
        , dragged : Maybe String
        }


{-| The key of the element being dragged, if any. Use it to style the dragged
element differently, e.g. with a shadow.
-}
dragged : Context state msg -> Maybe String
dragged (Context ctx) =
    ctx.dragged


{-| Make an element draggable. The string is a key identifying the element
(see [`key`](#key)); the function says what dragging does. It runs once, when
the drag starts, so it can look at the state it was drawn from:

    Drag.onDrag ctx "knob" (\() -> Drag.between [ { on = False }, { on = True } ])

Grabbing an element also brings it to the front for the duration of the drag.

-}

                    )
                ]


{-| Give an element an identity, so it can be followed from one state to
another. Elements with the same key in two states are treated as the same
thing, even if they sit in different groups, so blending moves them from one
place to the other instead of fading one out and the other in.

Give keys to the items of anything that gets rearranged: list entries, cards,
nodes in a tree. Keys must be unique within one drawing.

Keyed elements are drawn above the unkeyed drawing around them, nested keyed
elements above their keyed ancestors, and otherwise in the order they appear.
Use [`zIndex`](#zIndex) to change that.

-}
key : String -> Evg.Attribute a msg
key k =
    Attr (Internal.mixString k 1997) Layered.keyAttribute k (VirtualDom.attribute Layered.keyAttribute k)


{-| Stacking order among keyed siblings. Higher numbers are drawn later, so on
top; the default is 0, and negative numbers go below the element's keyed
parent. Only applies to keyed elements.

Everything in the drawing blends, not just the dragged element: positions,
sizes, colours, path shapes. With two states the element moves along the line
between them; with more it can move anywhere in the area they span, and
dragging outside that area slides along its edge.

{-| How [`between`](#between) weighs its states when there are three or more
that don't lie in a line.

  - `Barycentric`: the positions are joined into triangles and the pointer
    blends the three corners of the triangle it is in. Simple and
    predictable, but the blend changes direction abruptly when crossing from
    one triangle to the next.
  - `NaturalNeighbor`: blends every nearby state by how much of the
    neighbourhood the pointer "steals" from it. Smooth everywhere.

![A list being reordered with closest](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gampleman/evg/master/docs/images/drag-closest.svg)

Dragging the top row down: as the pointer passes each row, the whole list
jumps to the order with the grabbed row in that place.

On its own the dragged element snaps too, which can feel jerky; add
[`withFloating`](#withFloating) to let it follow the pointer while the rest
rearranges.

    units nearer. Stops flickering between two options that are about as
    good.
  - `lockPast`: once the current option has carried the dragged element this
    far from where it started, stick with it until it comes back. Useful when
    every option starts from the current state, so they all look equally
    good at first.

![A two-jointed arm following the pointer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gampleman/evg/master/docs/images/drag-vary.svg)

Above, a two-jointed arm whose hand is dragged with
`Drag.vary2 ( shoulder, elbow ) ...`: in every frame both angles are chosen
so that the hand sits under the pointer.

You never say how pointer movement maps to the value. The library finds the
value by trying values and looking where the element ends up, so it works no
matter how the value is drawn: as a position, an angle, a point along a
curve, or through several nested transforms.
